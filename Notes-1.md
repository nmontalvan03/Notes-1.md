# CIT 114 Week 1 
# IT is not just imagination and popular media, but it  can be help anyone with a computer issue.
Cloud computing  used for operations, hardware,software and infrastructure for  information 
such as remote servers hosted on the internet  to store and manage and process data, security.
#Information tecnology can be 
Computing power(CPU,RAM)

# Current and Future Information Technology (IT) Specialists will work on these:
1. Data Overload
2. Mobile and Wireless Usages
3. Cloud Services
4. Bandwidth for Video.
   
# One that I found interesting in IT was:

Hardware and software because this is important in cloud computing since without them nothin 
could be done and the system would not work correctly and there would be no security since the hardware make the cloud computing 
infrastructure like servers, processors and memory among other system that make up the hardware that include all the physical aspect system
and software follow the instructions, data or programs  to operate computers correctly  and execute task.
The Four Pillars of and IT Framework is important IT as it helps to code,
because this maintains the security of information that you want to keep confidential and take new responsibilities
and explore unfamiliar areas.
# These are Four Pillars of an IT
1. Infrastructure
2. Development
3. Security
4.Data

In cloud I learned many things susch as learning more about the component of the computer and what are the functions that it performs and because
it is important to back up the information in the cloud this gives you  greater ease, availability to find any information you need.

One of the questions that I have in my mind is What would happen if the system were to fail and you could not access the information that you have backed up in the cloud.
